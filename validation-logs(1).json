    "systemDescription": "StudentDeal is a web-based platform designed for university students and partner enterprises, similar to popular platforms like Amazon, Allegro, and eBay. It allows verified university students to purchase goods and services at discounted prices, while sellers—trusted companies verified by the university—gain access to a young customer base with long-term potential.\n\nTo develop the StudentDeal system, we are following the standard software development lifecycle. The process began by identifying the project's business assumptions—specifically, the need for a secure, student-focused e-commerce platform that benefits both students and businesses. We then initiated an iterative process of requirements gathering, focusing first on functional requirements (what the system should do), and currently emphasizing the elicitation of non-functional requirements (how the system should behave). These requirements will serve as the foundation for the system's design and implementation.\n\nThe core business assumptions of StudentDeal include:\n\nProviding a secure online marketplace for students through the verification of both buyers and sellers.\n\nEnsuring students can trust sellers due to university validation.\n\nEnsuring sellers can trust buyers as verified students.\n\nOffering students significant discounts on products and services.\n\nHelping sellers reach a valuable future customer base.\n\nThe platform's motto is:\n\"Stop looking for discounts, shop at StudentDeal for the best prices 24 hours 7 days a week.\"\n\nStudents will find offers for both products (e.g., watches, shoes) and services (e.g., beauty treatments), all at exclusive student prices. StudentDeal is designed with scalability in mind: initially launching for our university students, then expanding to other universities in the city, and ultimately to students across the country. At first, only existing business partners of the university will be able to post offers, but over time, the seller base will expand.\n\nFunctional requirements of the StudentDeal system include:\n\nStudents can browse offers, place orders, and make payments through an external payment system.\n\nStudents can view their purchase history.\n\nEntrepreneurs can create, update, and remove offers, change offer availability status, view transaction history, and manage settlements.\n\nGuests (non-logged-in users) can browse offers and register for an account.\n\nBoth students and entrepreneurs can log in/out, update account details, and delete their accounts.\n\nThe system integrates with the university’s student information system to periodically verify student status.\n\nAn administrator can activate or deactivate users and generate monthly platform usage and transaction reports.\n\nThe study will primarily focus on the third phase of the software development process: the elicitation and analysis of non-functional requirements, which are essential for ensuring system reliability, performance, and security.",

    "systemDescription": "StudentDeal is a web-based platform designed for university students and partner enterprises, similar to popular platforms like Amazon, Allegro, and eBay. It allows verified university students to purchase goods and services at discounted prices, while sellers—trusted companies verified by the university—gain access to a young customer base with long-term potential.\n\nTo develop the StudentDeal system, we are following the standard software development lifecycle. The process began by identifying the project's business assumptions—specifically, the need for a secure, student-focused e-commerce platform that benefits both students and businesses. We then initiated an iterative process of requirements gathering, focusing first on functional requirements (what the system should do), and currently emphasizing the elicitation of non-functional requirements (how the system should behave). These requirements will serve as the foundation for the system's design and implementation.\n\nThe core business assumptions of StudentDeal include:\n\nProviding a secure online marketplace for students through the verification of both buyers and sellers.\n\nEnsuring students can trust sellers due to university validation.\n\nEnsuring sellers can trust buyers as verified students.\n\nOffering students significant discounts on products and services.\n\nHelping sellers reach a valuable future customer base.\n\nThe platform's motto is:\n\"Stop looking for discounts, shop at StudentDeal for the best prices 24 hours 7 days a week.\"\n\nStudents will find offers for both products (e.g., watches, shoes) and services (e.g., beauty treatments), all at exclusive student prices. StudentDeal is designed with scalability in mind: initially launching for our university students, then expanding to other universities in the city, and ultimately to students across the country. At first, only existing business partners of the university will be able to post offers, but over time, the seller base will expand.\n\nFunctional requirements of the StudentDeal system include:\n\nStudents can browse offers, place orders, and make payments through an external payment system.\n\nStudents can view their purchase history.\n\nEntrepreneurs can create, update, and remove offers, change offer availability status, view transaction history, and manage settlements.\n\nGuests (non-logged-in users) can browse offers and register for an account.\n\nBoth students and entrepreneurs can log in/out, update account details, and delete their accounts.\n\nThe system integrates with the university’s student information system to periodically verify student status.\n\nAn administrator can activate or deactivate users and generate monthly platform usage and transaction reports.\n\nThe study will primarily focus on the third phase of the software development process: the elicitation and analysis of non-functional requirements, which are essential for ensuring system reliability, performance, and security.",
